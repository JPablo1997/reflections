*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?*
It's create a hidden file named .git, and after that you have a empty repository, we have to get lacated in git bash into the directory
that we want to create the repository and type git init.

*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?*
In the staging area it's like a reserved space where we can select which files we want to save changes, the value it that
it's really helpful to make just one logical change per commit, because we can add the files we want and save changes without the obligation
that could be save a lot changes per commit.
