*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?*
When we are working in a big project with another people, and we will making changes a lot of time, and we want to show the others what we did or viceversa.

*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?*
Because if we have public our remote, and someone else make commits, maybe we won't accept those commits. and we can save commits in a organize way.

*Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?*
Fork means create a copy of a repository into our account of github, clone that means create a copy of a repository in github or a local repository into our computer(local) not in github.
A branch is like a new version of a project, maybe a new feature, that we have  just experiment and we don't want to add into the master branch or main version.

*What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?*
For example the thing that we already seen, if we are working with other ppl, if they make changes that affect the work or
erase something important and we don't know exactly what it, with that copy we can know that, it's like a back up, really important.

*How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?*
Mmm maybe i would work in something of the project and pass to the others with a rar and then other person would work in the same
file, and so on. It would be harder because some people are lazy and maybe we will think that they are working on the project and they are doing nothing
and that would be a lost time because someone else would like to colaborate. and a thing easier for me don't exist.

*When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?*
When we don't make changes directly to the master branch maybe because we want to share our ideas with the co-workers, so then we make a pull request.
The benefits it's to make it more organized and always help to work in team.
