*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?*
When we are working in a big project with another people, and we will making changes a lot of time, and we want to show the others what we did or viceversa.

*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?*
Because if we have public our remote, and someone else make commits, maybe we won't accept those commits. and we can save commits in a organize way.

*Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?*
Fork means create a copy of a repository into our account of github, clone that means create a copy of a repository in github or a local repository into our computer(local) not in github.
A branch is like a new version of a project, maybe a new feature, that we have  just experiment and we don't want to add into the master branch or main version.
